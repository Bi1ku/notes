Shaw v. Reno

Facts:
  - None of north carolina's representatives were black
    - 20% of the state was black, so problem.
  - after 1990s census, north carolina redtricts to create two majority black districts

Gerrymandering - Congressional distrcts are drawn to favor one group over another
  - Racial gerrymandering
  - Partisan gerrymandering

Shaw's group argued that14th amendment was violated (equal protection under law) because district was drawn to favor 
black voters and race.

Reno's group argued that it was not violated because drawn with intention of helping underrepresented black residents.

The court eventually ruled against Reno because though they had good intentions of spreading representation, drawing
districts solely on race sets a bad precedent.
  - Equal protection clause was violated

Why it matters?
  - Resdistrcting only with race in mind is not constitutional.
