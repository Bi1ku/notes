Gun Free School Zone was passed by congress to prohbit guns in school zones.
  - But no where in the Constitution does it say that Congress can legislate and regulate guns. Not within their powers.
    - Gun regulation is a state issue
  - Loosely backed with the Commerce Clause
    - What in the world does that have to do with bringing guns to school?
      - Argument from U.S: Gun in school => violence in school => less travel from the people => negativly impacts commerce.
      Gun in school => learning deterioates => less educated citizenry => bad commerce
      - WEAK ARGUMENT
