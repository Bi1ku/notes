BRUTUS 1

Question: Which is better? Confederacy of state governments (like under Articles of Confederation) 
or a powerful and republican government?

Believed that the Elastic Clause and Supremacy Clause would result in the central government having absolute authority
to do anything without the state.
  - There is no need for state governments to intervene
  - Anything that state governments do that is inconsistent with this constitution is null and void
  - Therefore, all powers vested to the state governments is annilated, only for ceremonial purposes for the general government

Taxation is a key power, and too much taxation will result in the people overthrowing the government. How can there be a 
balance to both support the federal government and state government with taxes?
  - Therefore, power will further be sucked away from state legislatures to the federal one

Representation is very difficult in an extremely large population to represent all.
