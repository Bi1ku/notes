Federalist 10

Answers the question: How will the new Constitution protect the liberty
of citizens against the tyranny of the majority?

Framers didn't like a pure, participatory democracy because it meant that there
would be no protections to the minority (i.e., the majority faction would be
unchecked).

Madison is talking about the dangers of factions.

Factions - Group of people, majority or minority, united by their own interests,
to try to dominate the government and impose their influence.

Acknolwedges Two Solution:
  - Removing the root cause of why factions form
    - Madison says that this is a bad option because it destroys liberty and our
    freedom of speech and assembly. Essential to political life.
    - Or make everyone have the same opinions, but that's impossible because of 
    independent thoughts.
  - Limit their effects
    - Large, republican style government. Diversity => competeting intersts
      - More difficult to have one clear majority. Majority opinions will 
      get passed, but there are limits. PERFECT!
      - Power of factions dilute with large population and more factions.
      - More factions alos means competition => compromise => common good
      of society.
