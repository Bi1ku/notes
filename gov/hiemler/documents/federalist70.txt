Federalist 70

Justifying the need for a strong executive

Antifederalists (brutus) was afraid of this and instead wanted a executive council

Hamilton wanted a single executive because:
  - Faster decisions
  - More accountable
  - Easier to blame one person
  - Unity

Believed that other checks would be able to control a one-person executive

More executives => bitter divisons and less ability to control a
national emergency => civil war => deterioration of setate.
