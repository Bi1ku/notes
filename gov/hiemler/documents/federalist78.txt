Federalist 78

Regards the judiciary

- Liftime tenure is necessary.
  - BRUTUS and antifederalists argued that this was not representative
  - Federalist argued against this because they are not swayed by politics
  and public opinion.

- Has power of judicial review
  - If unconsitutional, null and void
  - Intermediate body to check the legfislature and executive
  - Not a check on the people
  - Not greater than the legislature because it represents the will of the people
    - Laws ruled unconstitutions are already inherently wrong.
