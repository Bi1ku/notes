Types of Democracy 4/13: Explain how models of representative democracy are
visible in major institutions, policies, events, or debates in the U.S.

Three different models:
  - Participatory democracy (kinda like direct democracy)
    - esp. in local politicals
    - Initiative and referendum
    - Constitution
      - Federalism
  - Elite democracy (opposite of participatory democracy)
    - Only well educated people should be able to vote and represent others
    - Electoral College, Supreme Court Justice Apointee system
    - Constitution:
      - Elected representatives legislate on behalf of the people (republicanism)
  - Pluralist democracy
    - NRA, NAACP
    - Persuade legislators and politics
    - Senate and House
    - Consitution:
      - Senate and House represent the interest groups of their states and all
      needs to be heard for laws to be passed

Brutus was against the Constitution and new government because they tyranny of
a powerful central government. Thought the states, and therefore, the people, 
would have no say.

Federalists argued that this fear was unfounded because of the diversity of factions
between all the states and competition would protect from tyranny.

Participartory democracy - argues for a large and board amouunt of people to
be directly involved in the law making and governing process.

Elite democracy - power is held in the well-educated and wealthy, who represent
(or sometimes doesn't) represent the people.

Pluralist democracy - people with common interests band together and share funds
to influence politics and policies in the law making process.
