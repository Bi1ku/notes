Government Power and Individual Rights 4/13: Explain how Federalist and
Anti-Federalist views on central government aand democracy are reflected
in U.S foundational documents.

Majority Rule vs. Minority Rights

Federalists (e.g., Alexander Hamilton, James Madison, John Jay)
  - Federalist Papers (FEDERALIST)
  - Federalist 10:
    - Issue: Concerning the "mischief of factions." If majority always prevailed, minority has nothing. If nothing ever
    prevailed, no good would happen.
    - Solution: Large and republican government and competing interest

Anti-Federalists (e.g., Patrick Henry, Geroge Mason)
  - Anti-Federalist Papers (BRUTUS)
  - BRUTUS-1:
    - Counters:
      - Never a republican government as large as the United States
      - Elastic clause => powerful central government => state governments
      are now unecessary => state interests are squashed
      - Liberity cannot exist with consitution
