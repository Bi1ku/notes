Challenges of the Articles of Confederation 4/13: Explain the relationship between
key provisions of the Articles of Confederation and the debate over
granting the federal government greater power formerly reservered to the states.

1st constitution of the United States of America

States were very independent shortly after indepedence. Acted as 13 different countries
instead of a a united federation.
  - There needed to be a central government that bound them together

Weak central government, strong state power:
  - They didn't want too muchc hange and avoided the tyranny of a very powerful
  central government.
  - BUT: there were a lot of drawbacks
    - Only congress, nothing else. No seperation of powers, no other jurisdiction.
    - Amendments need all states to agree to the change
    - No power to implement a national currency
    - No power to raise national army
    - No power to tax the people (i.e., federal government was broke).
      - Had to ASK states... BRUH
      - No money to pay debts to federal soldiers, other countries, etc.
  - Farmers in the army that wanted their promised money rebelled (Shay's Rebellion)
    - No army to protect and ensure national security
    - Exposed the problems of the federal government
    - What if next time they weren't put down?

=> government under the Untied States Consitution
