Principles of American Government: Checks and Balances and Seperation of Powers
Eplain the implications of both and where they originate from.

Seperation of powers: no one branch of government holds all the power or authority
  - Judicial vs. Legislative vs. Executive
  - Legislative Branch
    - Two houses that makes up congress
      - Senate
      - House
      - Makes Laws
  - Executive Branch
    - Enforce the law
  - Judicial branch
    - Interpret the law 
    - See if the laws are consitutional and orderly

Checks and balances: each branch has the ability to "check" the other branch to
make sure that no one branch goes insane.
  - E.g., Impeachment of President, Presidental Veto, 

Con: Very slow system,
Pros: Federalist 51 - prevent tyrannical government and leader.
  - Chief danger of government would be putting too much power in one

Stakeholders (individiuals) in all branches to check as well. Think: interest groups, 
sending emails, judiocial review, etc.
