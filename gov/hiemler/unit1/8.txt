Constitutional Interpretations of Federalism: Explain balance of power has been
different over time.

10th amendment: Any power not explicitly given to the federal government
and not prohibited to the states is reserved for the states.
  - Reserved Powers

14th amendment: Applied bill of rights to the states
  - Not only just in scope of federal government, but also against states too.

Commerce Clause: Congress has the ability to regulate interstate commerce
  - Used a lot in parallel with the elastic clause to expand federal power

Elastic Clause
  - Led to create the first national bank w/ justification in relation to commerce clause

Full Faith and Credit Cluase: Each state must respect each other's laws
  - Driver's license
  - Marriages

Mcculloch vs. Maryland -> elastic clause is valid
  - Supremacy law

United States vs. Lopez -> Gun free school zones act repealed because no justification
  - Gun laws and control are in the domain of the states, NOT to the federal government
