Legitimaxcy of the judicial branch and how other branches can check the judicial branch

Judicial Activisim - Establish policy... not a good thing
  - E.g.:
    - Warren Court & Brown v. Board of Education
    - Roberts Court & Citizens United v. FEC

Judicial Restraint - Only if it violates Consitituion
  - Purists of stare decisis
  - But can keep them from revamping decisions that NEED revamps

Pros and cons to both.

Most controversial decisions that led to questioning
  - Dred Scott V. Sandford
    - Dred Scott was an enslaved man taken to free state to serve master
    - Sued for freedom because violation of 1820 compromise
    - Roger Taney ruled he had no right because he wasn't a citizen of the U.S
      - Also, compromise was unconsitution because slaves were property
      - Judicial Activism because this conclusion didn't need to be made (i.e., compromise unconsitutional)
  - Korematsu v. United States
    - Japanese people were "threats" and had to be locked up
    - Ruled that it was constitutional because thought that it was reasonable asumption
    and threat to democracy. Hesitant to change.
    - Example of Judicial Restraint

How can court be checked?
  - Modifiying laws 
  - Constitutional Amendments to change meaning of constitution itself
  - Legislation that impacts Court's jurisdiction
  - Judicial Appointments
  - Not enforcing decision handed down
