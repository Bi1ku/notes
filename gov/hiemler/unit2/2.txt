  - Made other positions over time
  - Constitution only lists Speaker of the House
    - Voted for by members of Congress
    - Held by majority party
    - Recognizes who can speak, committee assignments, etc.
  - Majority and Minority Leaders
    - Guides their members towards certain stances in certain issues.
    - Direct debates on the floor
  - Majority and Minority Whips 
    - Makes sure that other party leaders are aligned with the overall party goals
    - Render party discipline

Senate:
  - President of the Senate is also V.P of U.S
  - President Pro Tempore
    - Leads Senate when V.P is away
  - Majority Leader:
    - Determines legislative agenda
    - Controls assignment of bills

System of committees to filter out all the proposed legislation.

Types of committees: standing committees, joint committees, select committees, 
conference committee
  - Standing committess are permanent. Forever issues/topics like taxation or 
  budget. Appropriations committee or way and means committee.
  - Joint committees are committees where both House and Senate are in for a dual
  jurisdiction topic like the library
  - select committees are temporary committees to solve a contemporary issue like
  Covid
  - conference committees are to resolve disputes between both houses when facing
  conflict in the law making process

House Rules Committee
  - Gatekeeper for all legislation, designates which legislation makes it to floor, 
  determines the logistics/rules/procedures of the debate.

Ability to discharge petition (automatically bring a bill to the floor) 
if 218 members sign it.

Senate filibuster & Cloture rule & Unanimous consent rule beforehand (agreemnent to not filibuster)

1. Bill proposed by member from House or Senate
2. Goes to committee debates, considered, changed, etc.
3. Debated on floor

logrolling, pork barrel spending, riders
  - riders are nonrelevent additions to try to sneak into a bill. or also try to help pass
  - pork barrell spending are riders that try to get more funding for sponsored legislature's disctric
  - logrolling: if you vote for my bill, i'll vote for yours

Mandatory Spending (medicaid, social security, medicare, etc.) vs. Discretionary Spending (usually paying federal employees)
