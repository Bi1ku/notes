Presidential Communication 4/15

Everyone knows who the president is! Not everyone knows who their congressional
representative is though...
  - Massive persuation influence over Congress via public interest
  - Bully Pulpit

Bully Pulpit - a public office or position of authority that provides its occupant
with an outstanding opportunity to speak out on any issue.

Over time, the president has used and adopted technologies to communicate with
the people.

Only constitutionally required statement from the president is the State of 
the Union Address in Article 3 to congress. Beginning of every year.
  - Newspapers & reporter bias => Radios (e.g., Fireside Chats) => Television =>
  Social Media Platforms (e.g., Trump's use of Twitter and Truth Social)
    - There are limits, however, to what they can say (e.g., Trump's involvment
    in the Jan. 6th riot).
