Balancing Majority and Minority Rights

How has the government responded to civil rights movements?

Civil Rights Movement:
  - Abolish segregation
    - Overturn Plessy v. Ferguson & the separate but equal doctrine
      - Example of SCOTUS restricting civil rights
    - Brown v. Board of Education essentially overturned Plessy v. Ferguson
  - Civil Rights Act of 1964 - Made it illegal to discriminate on the basis
  of race, color, or national origin. Everyone is equal to the same opportunities.
    - All segregation facilities not under Brown v. Board of Education had to
    integrate as well.
  - Voting Rights Act of 1965 - Illegal to discriminate in terms of voting.
  - 24th amendment outlawed voting taxes.

Womens Right:
  - Title IX of Education Amendment Act of 1972
    - Plugged up omission from Civil Rights Act to include gender
    - => Rise of woman sports programs

Majority-minority districts - a district in which the majority... is the minority.
  - No... it's bad.

Voting rights act made it clear that districts could not be drawn to dilute
the voting power of minorities.

Shaw v. Reno:
  - Racial Gerrymandering is no good. even if it tries to uphold the voting
  rights act.
