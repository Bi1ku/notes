Affirmative Action

How has SCOTUS restricted minority groups and protect minority groups?

Affirmative Action - Policies that favor groups that have been historically
discriminated against (e.g., latinos, blacks, native american, etc.).
  - Contentious topic. Many majorities (e.g., white people) have protested
  that these policies actually discriminate against them.
  - Constitutional or not?

De Jure Segregation - Racial discrimination by law
  - Shot down by Brown v. Board of Education

De Facto Segregation - Racial segregation by personal choice

Courts have generally ruled against affirmative action

Regents V. Bakke: 100 spots every year. Reserved 16 for minority groups.
  - Bakke denied admission but was qualified. Sued.
  - Because uni establied race and gender quotas, he was a victim of "reverse
  disccrimination."
  - Mandatory quotas were unconstitutional
    - Race, however, could be used. but couldn't be the ONLY thing that was used.

Ricci v. Destafano: Firefighter took a test for promotion. No black people got
past the threshold. Test was thrown out.
  - White firefighters sued.
  - Court agreed in their favor. Test seemed to be a good measure of knowledge
  for the job.
  - Another example of court operating from a colorblind perspective.
