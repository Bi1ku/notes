The First Amendment

Freedom of Religion

There is a balance with freedom of religion, it is not absolute. You can't just
say something is part of your religion and get away with it if it, say... obstructs
public wellbeing or a societal functions, for example.

"Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting
the free exercise thereof..."
  - Establishment Clause & Free Excercise Clause

Many have tried to weaken or strength the relationship between state and religion
  - E.g., Johnson amendment: Preachers can't say who they endorse unless their 
  church pays taxes

Engel vs. Vitale: Is prayer in public schools allowed?
  - Violation of the establishment clause
  - State-sponsored prayer in schools is unconstitutional

Wisconsin v. Yoder: Amish groups wanted to pull children out of public schools
in 8th grade for traditional, vocational training in like their farms or something.
Thought that requirements violated the free exercise clause.
  - Court agreed and upheld their thoughts

Employment Division v. Smith: Native American culture/ritual that used illegal drugs
  - Court ruled against since it was federally illegal and was a threat to society
