The First Amendment 

Freedom of Speech

Just like with any right, it's not absolute and you can't exploit it. You can't 
say things that prove a harm to others... think: yelling "fire" in a crowded
theater would scare society and may cause harm to other people trampling over
one another. There are restrictions to free speech.
  - That said that bar is high for the government to censor speech

Tinker v. Des Moines: Students in Iowa came into school with black arm bands
to protest the Vietnam War. Administration didn't allow them to continue wearing it,
claiming it was a distraction to learning. Students said it violated free speech.
  - Supreme Court ruled with the students that their first amendment rights
  had been violated.
  - Acknowledged that administration has the right to keep peace in their school,
  but there was no actual disruption, only the fear of disruption.
  - Right to symbolic speech was upheld.

Basically they can control the method speech is being done, but not message itself.

Morse v. Frederick: Student held up a very bad sign that had a lot of profanity.
Got suspended. Appealed the suspention and went in front of court.
  - Court ruled against since it promoted illegal drug use and din't have any
  other redeeming values of any kind.
    - Didn't protest anything
    - Social order needs to prevail

West Virginia Board of Education v. Barnette: West Virginia made it madatory
for students and teachers to salute the flag during certain activities.
  - Jehovah's witnesses said it went against their religion
  - Court agreed with Jehovah witnesses

Balance between individual freedoms and social order

How does court decide?
  - Time, place, and manner regulations
  - Defamatory, offensive, and obscene speech regulations
  - Clear and present danger rule

Schenck v. United States: Schenck made pamphlets that encouraged young men to avoid
the draft. Arrested.
  - SCOTUS ruled that convinctino was constitutional because his pamphlets
  incited unlawful actinos, creating a present danger to American society.
  - His speech presented a clear and present danger because it was illegal.

Brandenburg Test is the new standard. Makes it harder for government to prosecute
speech.
