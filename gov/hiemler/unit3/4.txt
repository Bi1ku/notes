Freedom of Press

Curcial to a free society.

We must balance right to free press with 6th amendment so keep certain details
out of the press.

or... when does national security override freedom of the press?
  - Prior Restraint

Prior Restraint - When the government tries to restain a story prior to
its publication
  - Standard has been set very high

New York Times v. United States: Midst of the Vietnam War. Classified documents
exposed to NYT and Washington Post => found out that President was lying about
how well the war was doing. Nixon envoked Prior Restraint.
  - Court ruled freedom of press was more important because he was more concerened
  about how it would tarnish his own image
  - Heavy presumption against prior restraint. Needs to be really clear about
  an immenient threat to the United States.
