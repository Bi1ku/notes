The Right to Bear Arms

District of Columbia v. Heller: Police officer wanted to carry his gun home for 
self-defense. But DC had so many restrictions in terms of gun laws, so he calimed
that it was in an attempt to [prevent him from bearing arms.
  - Court agreed with Heller. 
  - Though it does mention guns in the context of militias, which is outdated today,
  it doesn't dimihs the phrase "right to bear arms."
  - Only applies there because it's a federal district, not a state.

McDonald v. Chicago
  - Essentially applied Heller decision to the states
