Individual Freedom vs. Public Safety

I.e., balance between claims of individual freedom and enforcement, public saftey,
and the law.

8th amendment (no cruel punishments)& Death Penalty:
  - The government technically allows taking life.
    - "No person shall be drpived of LIFE, liberty, or property, WITHOUT due
    process of law."

Furman v. Georgia:
  - SCOTUS ruled that the APPLICATIONS behind the death penalty were unconsitutional.
  Not the punishment itself. If you killed a white person, more chance of getting
  death penalty than killing a black person.

Gregg v. Georgia: Georgia rewrote their death penalty laws to get rid of the racial
biases behind that made it cruel and unusual.
  - SCOTUS ruled that the death penalty in it of itself was constiutional

Death penalty still very contentious: many argue that people cannot be put to death
humanely.

2nd amendment

After sandy hook, anti gun interest groups lobbied ferociously and Obama issued
many executive orders to restrict guns and types of guns. Uphold public saftey
at the expense of individual liberties.
  - McDonald v. Chicago => individual gun rights upheld

4th amendment

After 9/11 attacks, country was in chock => President George W. Bush passing
Patriot Act which allowed government to monitor emails and personal data
of the american people. Meta data.

Many groups lobbied against this saying it went against the 4th amendment's
protection against unreasoable searches and seizures.
