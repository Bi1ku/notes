Selective Incorporation

Selective Incorporation is the process by which the Bill of Rights is applied to
the states.

14th Amendment: "No state shall make or enforce anyt law which shall abridge
the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States..."
  - Basically extends Bill of Rights to the states

Most of the time, SCOTUS does this job of selective incorporation.

Reynolds v. United States: Reynolds had many wives because he was a morman.
Utah had outlawed polygamy.
  - SCOTUS disagreed with Reynolds because though state couldn't outlaw the 
  belief of polygamy, they could with the act of polygamy.

McDonald v. Chicago: 
  - IF court ruled that second amendment allowed citizens of washington d.c
  to own handguns, same should be for the states
    - Stare decisis
