Conservatives don't like change and want to cherish the already-established
institutions and seek to preserve them for the good of society.

Liberals push for new reforms to make society for just and equal.

FOR EXAMPLE, during feminism in the mid-late 20th century:
  - Conservatives wanted to CONSERVE the traditional family structure in the 
  upper and middle classes.
  - Liberals wanted to empower women and break down injust social and restricting
  social structures.
