Ideology and Social Policy

How do policial ideologies shape our social policy?

Libertarians:
  - Want as little government as possible, even socially.
  - Only thing government is good for is protecting private property and upholding
  individual liberty.
  - Economically lean conservative, socially lean liberal.

Liberal Ideology:
  - Personal privacy
    - Abortion is a private decision
    - Who you marry
    - Marijuana

Conservative Ideology:
  - Abortion isn't a private matter because live baby
  - Marriage should only be between one man and one woman
  - Government out of gun ownership
  - Raising and education children: as little intervention as possible

Planned Parenthood v. Casey: 1980s, Penn laws had many restrictions against 
abortion (e.g., waiting 24hrs before, consent of parent, consent of husband):
  - Court upheld Roe v. Wade but also upheld the restrictions
    - Victory and loss for both

Zelman v. Simmons-Harris: Students in underperforming schools recieved vouchers
to whatever school they wanted. Some used to attend religious schools.
  - Liberals saw this as a violation of the First Amendment's establishment clause.
    - Government was paying for religious education.
  - Conservatives saw this move as upholding freedom of choice regarding education.
  - Court ruled with the conservatives. Parents sent them there by choice, so 
  didn't violate establishment clause.
