Changes in Ideology

Generations and age groups have influences on voting behavior.
  - Generalizations on the group, not 100%

Silent Generation (Pre-1945):
  - During Great Depression, WWII, etc.
  - Cold War - Against communism
    - Tough on crime, terrorism, etc.
  - Young adults during Age of Conformity
  - High value on religion
  - Rigid gender roles to men and women
  - Generally conservative
  - Vote in higher numbers

Baby Boomers (After WWII to Mid 60s):
  - Huge generation numerically after prosperity from WW2 and people coming back
  - Tumultuous 60s => learned to appreciate change more
    - Slighty more liberal than the silent generation
  - BUT, still vote conservative

Generation X (Mid 60s - 80s):
  - grew up with lots of divorce
  - first generation to really frow up with internet
  - more liberal than baby boomers and silent generation
  - more diverse than other groups

Millenials (1981 - 1996):
  - More liberal
  - More ethnically diverse than gen x
    - 40% not white
  - More favorably towards immigrants, more socialist policies, etc.

Older you are, more likely conservative. Younger, more likely liberal.

Life-Cycle Effects:
  - 18 year old vote to someone like Bernie Sanders who wanted free college tuition
    - if you're oldedr and have adult children, you wouldn't care about that
    - mid-life you might want lower taxes
