The influence of political evenots on ideology

E.g.,
  - Silent generation struggled through great depression, but FDR helped them
  and win wards, so they have more trust in the government and the U.S
  - Baby boomers lived through Vietname Wars and Pentagon Papers => Dramatic
  Loss in trust.
    - By election of 1980, republican popularity rose
      - Ronald Raegen: lassiez-faire perspective
  - Millenials and 9/11 attacks. American overintervention => higher emphasis
  on foreign relations.
    - Candidates who championed cooperation like Obama.

These are all GENERALLY.
