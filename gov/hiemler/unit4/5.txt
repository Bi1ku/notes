Measuring Public Opinion

Main Way: Scientific Polls

If a poll is created with scientific rigor, then it is the best tool to measure 
public opinion.

For a poll to have scientific rigor is the hard part:
  - The questions should be free from bias.
  - Random selection of people.
  - Generalize results to the larger population.

Types of Polls:
  - Opinion Poll
    - Get a feel for the public's opinion on a certain topic,
    certain candidates, or policies.
  - Benchmark Poll
    - Taken at beginning of a campaign to compare to how well they are doing.
  - Tracking Poll
    - Conducted over time with same group of people. Gives information about
    how an opinion devlopes over time in a certain group about a given issue.
  - Entrance/Exit Polls
    - Conducted at voting sites to ask people how they voted. Before => entrance
    After => exit.

Sampling Methodology:
  - Needs to be representative
  - Random

Sampling error:
  - There's always a chance that the sample will not exactly represent general pop.
  - +/- 3 sampling error is good

Neutral questions

Mass Surverys (Quantatative Data) vs. Focus Group (Qualatative Data)
  - Focus Groups aren't considered scientific polling since not numerical, but
  can be helpful.
