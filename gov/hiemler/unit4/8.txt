Ideology and Policy Making

How does polical ideology influence the policies that are made?

Only represents those who actually vote.

For Example:
  - English the Official Language of The United States
    - Conservative Arguments
      - Help unite people together
      - Save billions on translations
    - Liberal Arguments
      - Tool of oppression and ostrachization
      - Requiring immigrants to learn English is essentially forcing assimilation
      and erasing their culture.
  - Muliculturalism vs. Asssimilation
  - Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Act
    - Welfare rose for the poor, conservatives didn't like it because it trapped
    poor in a cycle of poverty because no incentive to work.
    - Limited welfare payment to five years
  - Dream Act
    - Immigrant children cannot be deported and put to education and can 
    eventually become citizens. Obama executive order.
    - Trump would later rescind this executive order.
