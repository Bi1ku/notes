Ideology and Economic Policy

How does political ideology shape economic policy?

Fiscal Policy - Decisions that the government makes about spending and taxation.

Monetary Policy - Decisions the government makes about how much money should be
in the economy.
  - Under control of federal reserve

Federal Reserve controls monetary policy by:
  - Buying and selling government bonds
  - Setting reserve requirements
  - Setting interest rates

Liberals spend a lot in fiscal policy to control the economy
  - Keynesian economics
    - FDR pumped up fiscal spending and implemented programs

Conservatives want a free economy so they have lower fiscal spending and taxes.
  - Supply-side economics
    - Support businesses instead of creating and spending money on programs.

Conservatives tend to favor monetary policy to stabilize the economy while liberals
tend to believe that monetary policy is too slow to effect real change.

Libertarian Ideology - Least amount of government intervention possible. No regulation
on businesses and no government programs. Basically kinda like exterme conservatives,
economically-speaking.
