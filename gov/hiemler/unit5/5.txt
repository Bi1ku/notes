Third Party Politics

Why don't third parties noat stand a ch'ance in a two party system?
Why can't third parties win?
  - Winnter take-alll voting distrcits
    - Whoever wins, even if by 1, all votes in that state goes to that party/candidate
  - Incorporation of third party agendas into the two major parties' platforms
    - E.g., Populist Party and farmers. Unlimited Coinage of silver was very popular.
    Democrats incorporated into their party. Many members voted democrat and helped
    them win.
  - Less funded, never, and less known than the major parties
    - Why vote if you guys will never win?
  - Many third parties are also very extreme and narrow views (e.g., Green Party
  and the Chrisitian Liberty Party.

Only way for third parties to really win is if why have a PORPORTIONAL SYSTEM.
  - Split votes. Opposite of winner take all votes
  - Seen in many european politics
