Iron Triangle & Issue Networks

Interest group's efforts are greatly influenced by the amount of funding they have
  - Policy makers want money, so more incentivized to take meetings with larger
  and more wealthy interest groups
  - Therefore, larger interest groups have more power and influence over
  the lawmakers.

Free riders are a problem.
  - Lot more people benefitting as compared to those who are actually advocating
