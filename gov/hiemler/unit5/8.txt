Electing the President

Candidates first have to earn their nomination throug primary elections.
  - Members of the party vote on who they want to represent them

Types of primaries:
  Open primaries - Anyone can vote in either one, but not both.

  Closed primaries - Only people registered in those parties can vote.

  Caucuses - Open discussion and debate. Vote publicly.

Whoever wins at thjose primaries will be represented in the national convention
and there they elect the candidate for the party.
  - Sitting president with one more term left is also the candidate (incumbent)

Incumbency advantage:
  - Already won, so experienced
  - People generally know what the incument will do
  - Already have army of resources, volunteers, and fundraisers

We don't actually vote for the president... you vote for electors...
