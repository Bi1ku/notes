Democracy - a system of selecting policymakers and of organizing governments so that policy reflects citizens' preferences.
  - The U.S government is a republic: representatives are chosen to make policies

Rober Daul's (American political theorist) five criteria for an ideal democratic process
  - Equality in voting: one person, one vote
  - Effective participation: equal opportunities to express thoughts
  - Enlightened understanding: free speech and press to spread information on politics
  - Citizen control of the agenda: no elite group gets more control over policy agenda
  - Inclusion: citizenship must be open to all subjects within the nation

Pluralism - groups with shared interests spread their beliefs through organized efforts
  - No one group will dominate due to the diversity of political insitutions and officials and competing groups
    - Public interest prevails

Elitism - political power is held in the wealty, who have the power to fund political candidate, and therefore, policy
  - After Citizens United vs. FEC (2010), the top 1% have been increasing funding political campaigns
  - Public interest cannot prevail
  - Campaigns are expensive and most rely on PACs funded by the elite
    - The PACs really only care about issues that affect them, specifically economic interests for the betterment of the top 1%

Hyperpluralism - too many competing and diverse pluralistic groups hinder the government's ability to effectively pass legislation and acts
  - Fragmentation of an clear agenda
  - Due to the nature of checks and balances of the U.S government, groups have judicial abilites as well to control or delay the passing of certain laws and actions
  - Single-interest groups have become sovereign
    - The actual public interest cannot prevail
  - No united agreements

Political confidence in our democracy has fallen throughout the years
