ORIGINS OF THE CONSTITUTION

Greogy Johnson won through the nature of the Consitution that puts free trials first.
  - Made burning flags legal for free speech.
  - Epitomizes rationality due to checks and balance. Some say too slow, some say too inefficient, some praise its protection of minority, etc.

A consitution is a nation's basic law. It creats political institutions, assigns the powers of governemnt, and often provides guarantees to citizens.

White colonists had good lives at the time of rebellion and it was very free due to salutory neglect.

After the French and Indian war, Britian began having a tigher rule over the colonies, imposing more taxes to pay debts and build defense
  - Also gained a shitload of land
  - Colonies lacked direct representation
    - Growing anger => boycotts => Boston Tea Party => naval blockage and more British soldiers sent => First Continental Congress to discuss relations with Britian.

Thomas Paine's Common Sense fanned fires of independence => Henry Lee on United States => Congress declaring indepdence.

Declaration of indepdence was very strongly against the king to have a scapegoat and to get allied with France.

New constitution based on enlightenment philosophers.
  - John Locke
    - Natural rights
    - Social contract and people can revolt against gov.
    - Limited government (clear restrictions and checks and balances)
    - Also really cared about property, but excluded from constitution
    - Almost verbatim, word for word with Locke's writings
  - Levellers
    - Popular sovereignty
    - Extended suffrage
    - Religious tolerance
  - Colonists
    - Patriotism
    - Unity

First of it's kind. Set precedent for others.

Won a statistically losing battle. Beat the odds and a new nation was declared.

Actually a conservative revolution, primary objective was to revert way of life to era of saultary neglect.
