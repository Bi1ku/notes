Certian rules in the COnsisution are NOT equal for certain parts of the policymaking process.

The Consitution ITSELF is not democratic at all.
  - Created by the upper class, for the upper class (think: John Jay)
  - But it did now create a monarcy or an autoracy, and inherented created a republic through teh traditional of limited government
  - permitted movement towards democracy (think: new amendmnents that expansion of suffrage to people of color and women)

Checks and balances play a big part on what hte government can and cannot do.
  - This also protects minorities because they can often find at least someone who shares their beliefs.
  - Also encourages stalemates. (esp. when difficult situations arises).

radiical departures from the status quo are atypical
