International relations => major changes in American federalism.

Dual Federalism - Both governments reign supreme in their own spheres. Powers should be rarely interrupted. Layer Cake

Cooperative Federalism - Sharing of powers and policy assignments. Marble Cake

Before, federalism leaned towards dual federalism. Today, it's cooperative.
  - Education as an example of this shift. Originally thought to be a power of the state and local governments, has now become vitally influenced by the national government.
    - E.g., Berkeley, Texas A&M, and more all have their origins in federal government land grants
    - More investment into education during space race with Russia.
    - Brown v. Brown of Education => desegregation
    - No Child Left Behind Act
    - Primary source of fin. aid. (2/3 of all)
    - Funds and donates to public universities
  - Highways and public infrastructure as another example.
    - Joint project between both federal and state government now.

Cooperative Federalism is characterized by:
  - Shared costs (pay together)
  - Federal guidelines (grants)
  - Shared administration (jobs -> hiring)

Congress can encourage states to pass laws by witholding grants and fundings for certain projects (e.g., no highway funds unless 21 drinking age)
  - Today, 21 is the legal age in every state.

Greater central gov. power has not gone unchallenged.
  - Period of devolution when republicans were the majority in both houses
    - Died out and turned to more national gov. powers to achieve their goals
    - Now both parties would like greater federal power. Democrats set minimums, republicans set maximums.

The citizens like this more pragramatic apporahc, especially due to national issues like covid.

Fiscal Federalism - grants by the federal governmenyt are used to both aid and influence states and localities.

Categorical grants - grants to the state that can only be put to a specific cause. Most of the grants are categorical grants.
  - Come with restrictions and requirements
  - Crossover sanctions - must meet a particular rule to get a grant
  - Crosscutting requirements - requirement on one grant applies to all other active funding
  - TWO TYPES:
    - Project grants - dermined on compeititve applications of projects/proposals 
    - Formula grants - determined on a formula calculator

Block grants are grants with no strings attached. Given automatically to states and can be delegated for any purpose.

States compete for $750 billion in grants every year. They have dozens of employees who research and find grants that the state's can qualify for.

Categorical grants and mandates strain state budgets => some states choose to not take these grants or sue the federal government.
