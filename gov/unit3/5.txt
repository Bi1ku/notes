Diversity in the policies between different states is good because it sets a status quo and an experimental ground for new, innovactive actions that may be imitated through the federal government.

How has federalism improved democracy?:
  - Decentralizes politics: voters vote for representatives of state, representatives then advocate for interests in that state. => democracy
  - Reduces conflict: most issues are solved locally, so more effective national government
  - Diversity of policy: test new policies out locally. if works well, more states will adopt and maybe even national
  - More opportunities to particpate: vote, run, advocate, etc.
  - Increased access to government
  - Losing is more acceptable
  - Minority also wins -- happy family
  - Local interests have the power to lobby against majorities

Federalism, however, burdens and confuses citizens with our large and complex government.
