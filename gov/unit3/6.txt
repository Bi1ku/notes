How did the federal government get so much power?
  - Through the economic domain. (think: great depression, tariffs, 9/11).
  - As U.S developed, more demain for governmental action => increase in power
    - E.g., monopoly on railroads and other industries 
    - E.g., protection of rights and regulations in workplaces
    - E.g., urbanization => environmental, housing, and welfare programs
  - State governments don't have as much resources and such problems are universal--applies to the whole nation, not locally
    - Geographical issues, causations maybe aren't local?
    - How can a state regulat an international business like General Motors? Or Standard Oil Company?
    - Less efficient generally.
