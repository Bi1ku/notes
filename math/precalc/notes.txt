Odd function: f(x) = -f(-x). 180 degree rotation around origin
Even function: f(x) = f(-x) 
  - reflection over y-axis
  - f(x) = f(-x)

Concave Up: the slope is increasing (getting more positive)
Concave Down: the slope is decreasing (getting more negative)
Point of inflection: the point where the concavity changes. (E.g., slope increasing => slope decreasing)
Rate of change vs. AVERAGE rate of change

Log properties (all)
log a + log b = log (a * b)
log a - log b = log (a / b)
log a^n = n log a
b ^ log base b (k) = k
log base b (b^k) = k
change of base (a to b) = log base b (k) / log base b (a)

Rose graphs
acos(xn) asin(xn)
cos is on x-axis (a > 0 to the right, a < 0 to the left)
sin is on the y-axis (a > 0 to the down, a < 0 to the up)
if x is even, then 2x petals
if x is odd, then x petals
a is the petal length

Limacons
a + bcos(x) a + bsin(x)
sin => symmetry over y-axis
cos => symmetry over x-axis
a/b < 1 => loop
a/b = 1 => cardiod
1 < a/b <= 2 => dimple

Binomal expansion
(a + b)Ë†n = n sigma k = 0 (n choose k) a^(n-k) b^k
(n choose k) = n! / (k!(n-k)!)

Exponential functions
ab^x
-a => reflection over y axis
-x => reflection over x axis
  - Relate to properties of negative exponents
b > 0 => 

Double angle 
sin(2x) = 2cosxsinx
cos(2x) = cos^2x - sin^2x
cos(2x) = 2cos^2x - 1

Pythagorean identities
sin^2x + cos^2x = 1
1 + tan^2x = sec^2x
1 + cot^2x = cot^2x

Adding subtracting sin cos
sin(a + b) = sin(a)cos(b) + cos(a)sin(b)
sin(a - b) = sin(a)cos(b) - cos(a)sin(b)
cos(a + b) = cos(a)cos(b) - sin(a)sin(b)
cos(a - b) = cos(a)cos(b) + sin(a)sin(b)

Properties of sin and cos
sin(-x) = -sin(x)
cos(-x) = cos(x)

Rational functions
degree on top is less, y = 0
degree on top is equal, y = a/b
degree on top is greater, slant asymptotoe

Inverse function (x, y) => (y, x)
  - reflection over y = x

Odd functions (x, y) => (-y, -x)
  - refletion over origin
  - 180 degree rotation around origin
  - reflection over x-axis and y-axis
  - f(-x) = -f(x)
  - f(x) = -f(-x)
