3. Check for verb form (gerund, participle, infinitive, etc.)

GENERAL NOTES:
- If a question asks you to summarize a study, summarize the WHOLE study, which is usually all the bullet points, not just the methodology.
- Make sure you have a good understanding of the text. Read slow and sometimes reread if you don't understand something. Knowledge is priority.

MISTAKES:
- GERUNDS CAN BE SUBJECTS
